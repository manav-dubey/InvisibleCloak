# **Invisible Cloak using OpenCV**

This project implements the famous **"invisible cloak"** effect using OpenCV and Python. The program allows the user to capture a background image and then replace a specific color (**light pink**, by default) in real-time with the background, creating the illusion of invisibility.

## **Features**

-   **Capture background** using the 'b' key
-   **Real-time detection** and removal of pink-colored cloth
-   **Adjustable HSV range** using trackbars for fine-tuning
-   **Noise removal** for better detection
-   **Display of real-time HSV values** for better debugging

## **Requirements**

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before running the script:

```sh
pip install opencv-python numpy

Usage
Run the script:

python invisible_cloak.py

A window will open displaying the camera feed.

Press 'b' to capture the background.

Hold a light pink cloth in front of the camera to observe the cloak effect.

Use the HSV trackbars to fine-tune the color detection.

Press 'q' to exit the program.

How It Works
The background is captured when the user presses 'b'.

The live video feed is converted to the HSV color space
