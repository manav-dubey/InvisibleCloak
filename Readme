# **Invisible Cloak using OpenCV**

This project implements the famous **"invisible cloak"** effect using OpenCV and Python. The program allows the user to capture a background image and then replace a specific color (**light pink**, by default) in real-time with the background, creating the illusion of invisibility.

## **Features**
- **Capture background** using the 'b' key
- **Real-time detection** and removal of pink-colored cloth
- **Adjustable HSV range** using trackbars for fine-tuning
- **Noise removal** for better detection
- **Display of real-time HSV values** for better debugging

## **Requirements**
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before running the script:

```sh
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

## **Usage**
1. **Run the script:**
   ```sh
   python invisible_cloak.py
   ```
2. A window will open displaying the camera feed.
3. **Press 'b'** to capture the background.
4. Hold a **light pink cloth** in front of the camera to observe the cloak effect.
5. **Use the HSV trackbars** to fine-tune the color detection.
6. **Press 'q'** to exit the program.

## **How It Works**
1. **The background is captured** when the user presses 'b'.
2. The **live video feed is converted** to the HSV color space.
3. The program **detects pink pixels** using a predefined HSV range (**adjustable via trackbars**).
4. The detected pixels are **replaced with the previously captured background**.
5. The final image is displayed with the illusion of **invisibility**.
